  <h1>Terminal Block Elements</h1>
  <p>
    Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, definition terms, addresses,
    and table captions are terminal block elements. They may contain only content.
    An HTML validator will declare a document invalid if you attempt
    to put block elements inside terminal blocks.
